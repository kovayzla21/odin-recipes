    <p>Finally the perfect white bread in my new bread machine. I’ve used bread machines for years, but was having trouble with this new one. I used the 1 1/2 lb setting (12 servings per recipe) on medium crust. I used pink Himalayan salt ground fine because that’s all we use. Early during the first kneed I checked for moisture by touch and added 2 T. of flour to counter the stickiness. May not need to next time. This is a necessary step anytime making bread by machine or hand. Moisture in the air changes the amount flour needed. The dough should be soft and smooth, not sticky or dry/flaky. The loaf rose perfectly, was light and tender, browned evenly, and my hubby who hates white bread scarfed it down saying this is the best bread yet. I was going to return the machine but not now. For this loaf alone it’s worth keeping.</p>
