    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the BEST dinner rolls I've ever made. They also make great buns for sandwiches. For a festive presentation, sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds before baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup dry milk powder</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bread flour, sugar, salt, milk powder, water, butter, and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Set on Dough cycle; press Start.</li>
        <li>Remove risen dough from the machine, deflate, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces, and form into rounds. Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the egg white and 2 tablespoons water; brush lightly onto the rolls. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
